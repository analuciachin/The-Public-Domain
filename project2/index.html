					<p>Suddenly he became alertly tense. Sound, sight, and odor had given him  a simultaneous warning. His hand went back to the old man, touching  him, and the pair stood still. Ahead, at one side of the top of the  embankment, arose a crackling sound, and the boy's gaze was fixed on the  tops of the agitated bushes.</p>

					<p>Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.&mdash;By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e'en take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!</p>

					<p>On his back was a quiverful of arrows. From a sheath hanging about his  neck on a thong, projected the battered handle of a hunting knife. He  was as brown as a berry, and walked softly, with almost a catlike tread.  In marked contrast with his sunburned skin were his eyes&mdash;blue, deep  blue, but keen and sharp as a pair of gimlets. They seemed to bore into  aft about him in a way that was habitual. As he went along he smelled  things, as well, his distended, quivering nostrils carrying to his brain  an endless series of messages from the outside world. Also, his hearing  was acute, and had been so trained that it operated automatically.</p>
					<p>Without conscious effort, he heard all the slight sounds in the apparent  quiet&mdash;heard, and differentiated, and classified these sounds&mdash;whether  they were of the wind rustling the leaves, of the humming of bees and  gnats, of the distant rumble of the sea that drifted to him only in  lulls, or of the gopher, just under his foot, shoving a pouchful of  earth into the entrance of his hole.</p>
					<p>Suddenly he became alertly tense. Sound, sight, and odor had given him  a simultaneous warning. His hand went back to the old man, touching  him, and the pair stood still. Ahead, at one side of the top of the  embankment, arose a crackling sound, and the boy's gaze was fixed on the  tops of the agitated bushes.</p>
					<p>Then a large bear, a grizzly, crashed into  view, and likewise stopped abruptly, at sight of the humans. He did not  like them, and growled querulously. Slowly the boy fitted the arrow to  the bow, and slowly he pulled the bowstring taut. But he never removed  his eyes from the bear.</p>
